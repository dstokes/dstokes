# Hi ðŸ‘‹
 
I'm a senior engineering manager at [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/). Previously, I've worked in database and systems administration, front-end and fullstack development, and site reliability engineering. The quickest way to nerd-snipe me is with a good puzzle. ðŸ¤“

If you're looking for my personal readme, you can find it [here](https://github.com/dstokes/README).
